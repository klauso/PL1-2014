/** 
This model of garbage collection does not illustrate the difficulty of memory management. In most languages, the size of the allocated memory regions on the heap vary, and hence one needs an algorithm to find a free and large-enough spot on the heap. There are various algorithms and heuristics (best-fit, worst-fit, first-fit, ...) for that purpose.

There are also various alternative gc designs. Mark-and-sweep is a non-moving algorithm, where reachable heap objects are never moved. In contrast to that, copying gc algorithms move the reachable objects to a different portion of the heap. One of the oldest algorithms is the semi-space garbage collector, in particular with the implementation purpose.

     http://www.cs.umd.edu/class/fall2002/cmsc631/cheney/cheney.html

Topic for class discussion: What are the pros and cons of moving vs. non-moving gc?
 
It can be shown empirically that most unreachable objects become unreachable while they are still young. Generational gc algorithms take this empirical fact into account and divide the objects into generations, whereby the (small) youngest generation of objects is garbage-collected more frequently.
 
A typical problem of the simple gc algorithms we discussed is the stop-the-world phenomenon: All execution has to be stopped during a gc cycle. This issue is addressed by incremental or concurrent garbage collectors. Incremental garbage collectors typically reduce* the total throughput but increase responsiveness and real-time behavior.
 
A completely different approach to memory management is _reference counting_. In reference counting, each object on the heap (in our case, each box) maintains a counter which says how many pointers currently point to that object. The counter is adjusted whenever a pointer variable is assigned to this object (incremented), or from this object to another object (decremented). When the counter is 0, the object can be reclaimed.

The obvious disadvantage of reference counting is that it cannot detect cycles on the heap. Hence reference counting algorithm must be augmented with some means to detect cycles.
