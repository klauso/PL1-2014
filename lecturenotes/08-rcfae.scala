However, sumattempt won't work and yield an unbound identifier error (why?). An alternative would be to use a variant of the y combinator to support recursion properly, but today we want to talk about direct support for recursion. More specifically, we want a language construct "letrec" that is similar to "with",  except that the bound symbol can be used in the expression the symbol is bound to:

Using letrec, our example can be expressed as follows.

/** 
Let's now consider the semantics of letrec. Consider the evaluation of ``Letrec(x,e,body)`` in an environment ``env``.

What environment should we use to evaluate e and body, respectively? Using env for e will produce a ``ClosureV(Fun('n,...'sum'...),env)``, and hence the environment when evaluating body will be ``envbody = env + (x -> ClosureV(Fun('n,...'sum...),env))``. This is bad, because the ``env`` in the closure does not contain a binding for ``'sum`` and hence the recursive invocation will fail. 

The environment in the closure must contain a mapping for ``'sum``. Hence envbody should look like

    envbody = env + (x -> ClosureV(Fun('n, ...'sum...), 
                                   env+('sum -> ClosureV(Fun('n,...'sum...),env)))
 
This looks better, but now the second closure contains an environment with no binding of ``'sum``. What we need is an environment that satisfies the equation:

    envbody == env + (x -> ClosureV(Fun('n, ...'sum..), envbody))

Obviously envbody must be circular. There are different ways to create such a circular environment. We will choose mutation to create a circle. More specifically, we introduce a mutable pointer to a value (class ValuePointer) which will be initialized with a null pointer. In the Letrec case, we put such a ValuePointer in the environment and evaluate the (recursive) expression in that environment. Then we update the pointer with the result of evaluating that epxression.
 
The only other change we need to make is to dereference a potential value pointer in the Id case. We deal with the necessary case distinction by a polymorphic "value" method.

Due to the mutual recursion between ValueHolder and Value the definitions are put into an object.
