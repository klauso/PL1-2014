/** 
Mutation
========
Today we study _mutation_. More specifically, we want to equip our language with mutable data structures.  Typical mutable data structures in common languages include objects with mutable fields or structures/records in languages like C or Pascal.

We will study a particularly simple mutable data structure: Boxes. In OO parlance, boxes can be thought of as an object with a single field that can be mutated. Despite their simplicity, boxes already illustrate all main issues associated with adding mutable state to a language.

A different and less interesting form of mutation is the mutability of _variables_, such as the possibility to assign something to a 'local' variable bound via a lambda or ``with``. We will not talk about mutable variables today.

We will add boxes to our base language, FAE.

/** 
should give as result ``1`` in a proper implementation. 

Let's consider how our interpreter could handle sequencing.
 
Here is an attempt:

     case Seq(e1, e2) => {
       eval(e1, env)
       eval(e2, env)
     }

This cannot be correct. As long as our interpreter does not use mutation, evaluation could not make any changes to the environment, hence there is* no way the evaluation of e1 could have any effect on the evaluation of e2.
 
In order to demostrate the actual nature of mutation, we will not use mutation in our meta-language to implement mutation in our object language. That said, we will not use a mutable data structure to implement environment in our interpreter.

Instead, one may turn to the so-called environment-passing style, in which the interpreter returns also a possibly updated environment together with the computed value when it evaluates an expression.  However, this solution does not always work.  Consider the following example:
*/

val test2 = wth('a, NewBox(1),
              wth('f, Fun('x, Add('x, OpenBox('a))),
                Seq(SetBox('a,2),
                  App('f, 5))))

/** 
The mutation should affect the box stored in the closure bound to ``f``.  But with the implementation strategy described above it would not.

Note that changing the value of a in the example is not a vialation of static scope.  Scoping only says where an identifier is bound; it does not say to what an identifier is bound, in particular, whether whatever bound to the identifier is fixed.  Indeed, the variable a is bound to the same box in both the static environment where the function f is created and the dynamic environment where the function f is applied.

As before, when applying the function f to the argument 5, we can choose either

   1) To use the static environment (where the variable a is bound to a boxed 1) stored in the closure created for f.
   2) Or to use the dynamic environment (where the variable a is bound to a  boxed 2) present at the time of applying f.

The first choice leads the program to evaluate to 6 rather than the expected 7.  The second will record the change to the box, but it reintroduces dynamic scoping.  So both choices do not work.

Insight: We need _two_ repositories of information.
 
One, the environment, guards static scope.

/** 
Note that garbage collectors only _approximate_ the set of semantically disposable store entities. Even with garbage collectors, applications may very well suffer from memory leaks. The approximation should be _safe_, in the sense that a datum is never reclaimed when it is used by subsequent computations. Furthermore, it must reclaim enough garbage to be actually useful. Reachability has turned out to be a rather useful (and sound) approximation of semantic disposability. Garbage collectors must also be efficient. Efficiency of GC is a huge research topic that we are not going to discuss. One efficiency problem with garbage collectors based on reachability that we want to mention is the "stop-the-world" phenomenon.
