/** 
We have seen various patterns of function composition:

- The environment passing style, in which an environment is passed down in recursive calls
- The store passing style, in which a store is threaded  in and out of every computation
- The continuation passing style, in which every function call is a tail call.

Monads are way to abstract over such patterns of function composition. 

Motivation
----------

Using monads, we can write code which can be parameterized to be in 
one of the styles above (or many others).

Here is another common pattern of function composition. Suppose we have the following API of (nonsensical) functions:
*/
def f(n: Int) : String = "x"
def g(x: String) : Boolean = x == "x"
def h(b: Boolean) : Int = if (b) 27 else sys.error("error")

def clientCode = h(!g(f(27)+"z"))

/** 
Now suppose that these functions can possibly fail (say, because they involve remote communication). A common way to deal with such failures is to use the Option datatype: 
*/

def f(n: Int) : Option[String] = if (n < 100) Some("x") else None
def g(x: String) : Option[Boolean] = Some(x == "x")
def h(b: Boolean) : Option[Int] = if (b) Some(27) else None

/** 
However, now the clientCode must be changed rather dramatically: 
*/

def clientCode = 
  f(27) match {
    case Some(x) => g(x+"z") match {
	                     case Some(y) => h(!y)
						 case None => None
					}
	case None => None
  }
 
/**
We see a kind of pattern in this code. We have a value of type ``Option[A]``, but the next function we need to call requires an A and produces an ``Option[B]``. If the ``Option[A]`` value is ``None``, then the whole computation produces ``None``. If it is ``Some(x)`` instead, we pass ``x`` to
the function.

We can capture this pattern in the form of a function: 
*/

def bindOption[A,B](a: Option[A], f: A => Option[B]) : Option[B] = a match {
    case Some(x) => f(x)
	case None => None
}	

/** 
Using bindOption, we can rewrite the code above as follows: 
*/

def clientCode =
  bindOption(f(27), (x:String) => 
      bindOption(g(x+"z"), (y:Boolean) =>
	    h(!y)))
		


/** 
Now suppose that our original client code was not ``h(!g(f(27)+"z"))`` 
but instead ``!g(f(27)+"z")``. How can we express this with bind? This
thing does not type check:

    def clientCode =
      f(27) bind ((x: String) =>
      g(x+"z") bind  ((y: Boolean) =>
      !y))

One way to fix the situation is to insert a call to ``Some``, like so:  
*/
      
def clientCode =
  bindOption(f(27), ((x: String) =>
  bindOption(g(x+"z"), ((y: Boolean) =>
  Some(!y)))))

/** 
While this works, it is incompatible with our original goal of abstracting over the function composition pattern, because the Some constructor exposes what kind of pattern we are currently dealing with. Hence let's abstract over it by adding a second function "unit" to our function composition interface: 
*/

def unit[A](x: A) : Option[A] = Some(x)

def clientCode =
  bindOption(f(27), ((x: String) =>
  bindOption(g(x+"z"), ((y: Boolean) =>
  unit(!y)))))
  
/**
This looks better, but the types of unit and bind still reveal that we are dealing with the "Option" function composition pattern. Let's abstract over the Option type constructor by turning the type constructor into a parameter. The resulting triple (type constructor, unit function, bind function) is called a _monad_. Certain conditions (the "monad laws") on unit and bind also need to hold to make it a true monad, but we'll defer a discussion of these conditions until later.

The Monad Interface

So here it is: The Monad interface.

  // 2) Bind enjoys an associative property
  //     bind(bind(x,f),g) == bind(x, y => bind(f(y),g))

*/

/** 
For-Comprehension Syntax
------------------------  
All these nested calls to bind can make the code hard to read. Luckily, there is a notation called "monad comprehension" to  make monadic code look simpler. Monad comprehensions are directly supported in Haskell and some other languages. In Scala, we can piggy-back on the "For comprehension" syntax instead. 

A "for comprehension"  is usually used for lists and other collections. For instance:

    val l = List(List(1,2), List(3,4))
    assert( (for { x <- l; y <- x } yield y+1) == List(2,3,4,5))

The Scala compiler desugars the for-comprehension above into calls of the standard map and flatMap functions. That is, the above for comprehension is equivalent to:

    assert(l.flatMap(x => x.map(y => y+1)) == List(2,3,4,5))

We will make use of for-comprehension syntax by supporting both ``flatMap`` (which is like ``bind``) and ``map`` (which is like ``fmap``). We support these functions by an implicit conversion to an object that supports these functions. That is, our new monad interface is:
